Privacy Policy for "Cheese Tower"
Effective Date: April 22, 2025

Thank you for playing "Cheese Tower"! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how PNDStudio handles information regarding this mobile application ("Game").

1. Information Collection and Use
We do not collect any Personal Information (such as name, email address, etc.) that directly identifies you through this Game without your explicit consent.

The Game functions locally on your device. We currently do not automatically collect potentially identifying information such as unique device identifiers, precise location, or extensive usage data linked to you or your device. Any game progress is stored locally.

(Developer Note: This section assumes no third-party Analytics (like Firebase, Google Analytics) or Ad networks (like AdMob) are currently integrated. If you add these later, this section MUST be updated to disclose the specific data collected by you and by those third parties, linking to their privacy policies as required by Google Play.)

Any non-personal, aggregated information potentially processed locally is used only for ensuring the proper functioning of the game and improving the gaming experience locally.

2. Data Sharing and Disclosure
Since we do not collect personal information, we do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal data to third parties.

(Developer Note: If you add third-party services later (ads, analytics, leaderboards), this section MUST be updated to describe what data is shared with them and under what circumstances.)

3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
This Game currently does not use cookies or other similar tracking technologies (like advertising IDs or SDKs for analytics/advertising) to collect user behavior data.(Developer Note: If you add third-party SDKs later, this section MUST be updated to detail their use and provide opt-out information where applicable.)

4. Data SecurityWe take reasonable measures to protect any game data stored locally on your device. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.

5. User RightsAs we do not collect personal information that identifies you, rights related to accessing, modifying, or deleting stored personal data are generally not applicable to this Game in its current state. If you have questions about locally stored game data, please contact us. You may also have rights regarding advertising identifiers provided by your device operating system (e.g., opting out of personalized ads), which can typically be managed in your device settings.

6. Children's PolicyThis Game is not intended to knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or other relevant age threshold depending on your region, e.g., 16 in the EEA). We do not collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, please contact us so that we can take necessary actions to remove such information.

7. Changes to This Privacy PolicyWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the game or on its store listing page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when they are posted.
